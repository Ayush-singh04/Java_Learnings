Welcome to my personal playground for learning and mastering Java programming! This repository serves as a structured collection of code examples, exercises, and small projects that I've developed throughout my journey of learning Java.

My goal with this repository is to:

Solidify my understanding of core Java concepts.

Practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

Implement various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Java.

Track my progress and showcase my coding skills.
